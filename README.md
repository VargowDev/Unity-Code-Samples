# Unity-Code-Samples
This repository contains selected code samples from my Unity projects, showcasing my skills as a Unity Developer. Each script is carefully chosen to demonstrate specific systems or mechanics implemented in the context of game development.

**The examples include solutions for:**

- Turn-based combat systems
- Save and load mechanics
- Unit placement and grid-based interactions
- UI integration with game logic
- Dynamic and modular systems
- These scripts are taken from real projects, including my personal game project, Warlords of Arcania. They represent my approach to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

**Purpose**
The purpose of this repository is to provide a snapshot of my coding abilities for recruiters, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work as a Unity Developer. The examples highlight my skills in:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in C#
- Unity game development
- Designing scalable and reusable systems
- Solving complex gameplay problems
