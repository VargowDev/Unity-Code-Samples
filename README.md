# Unity-Code-Samples
This repository contains selected code samples from my Unity projects, showcasing my skills as a Unity Developer. Each script is carefully chosen to demonstrate specific systems or mechanics implemented in the context of game development.

**The examples include solutions for:**

- Turn-based combat systems
- Save and load mechanics
- Unit placement and grid-based interactions
- UI integration with game logic
- Dynamic and modular systems
- These scripts are taken from real projects, including my personal game project, Warlords of Arcania. They represent my approach to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this repository is to provide a snapshot of my coding abilities for recruiters, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work as a Unity Developer. The examples highlight my skills in:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in C#
- Unity game development
- Designing scalable and reusable systems
- Solving complex gameplay problems

**Scripts Included:**

**1. TurnSystem**

A core script for managing turn-based gameplay, including unit queues, turn progression, and event handling.

**2. SaveSystem**

Handles saving and loading game state using JSON serialization, with support for complex data structures like quests, units, and inventory.

**3. UnitPlacementUI**

Manages the UI and logic for unit placement before battles, integrating grid validation and dynamic UI updates.

**4. SpellCastAction**

Manages the spellcasting action, including spell selection, targeting, visual and audio animations, and application of spell effects to units.

**5. UnitStats**

Manages unit statistics, unit modifications, and logic related to damage, experience, and levels.

**6. PathManager**

Spline-based pathfinding system that uses graphs to represent paths and nodes.
